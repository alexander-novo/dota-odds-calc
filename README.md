# dota-odds-calc
A small calculator for figuring out how many boxes you need to open in Dota 2 to get the item you want. There are three options when running:
1) **expected-value** - Enter the treasure opening you are on (can be seen in the Dota 2 client by clicking on the odds arrow in a treasure) and the rarity of the item you want, and the calculator will tell you how many treasure you are expected to need to open to get that item.
2) **probability** - Enter the treasure opening you are on, the rarity of the item you want, and how many additional boxes you will purchase, and the calculator will tell you the probability of getting the item in that many boxes
3) **chart** - Enter the rarity of the item you want, as well as the maximum trasure opening and maximum number of additional boxes, and the calulator will plot the above information for all values through those maximums into a .csv file
